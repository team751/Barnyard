# Barnyard
## A modern new NFC-based part management system

Barnyard is a new part management system based off cheap NFC NTAG213 tags for part identification. The NTAG tags contain a Unique ID used for identification in Google Sheet database, where all the part data is stored.

Barnyard requires a libnfc compatible NFC reader, a PC, and some NTAG213 tags to get started.
